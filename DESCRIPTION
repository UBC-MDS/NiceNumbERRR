Description: This R package provides basic functions that make numbers display nicely. 
             In most real-world problems, the datasets are raw and we need to deal with 
             number formats to make them readable for humans or for computers. 
             Usually, a few or more lines of coding are needed while dealing with 
             number-display problems so we are thinking of compressing the time and 
             programming work on this issue. This package solves this kind of 
             problems in a way of transfer forward and backward from long digit 
             numbers to human-readable ones. There are functions doing single 
             number transactions, column transactions from a pandas data frame, 
             and displaying colors of input numbers.
