Description: This R package provides basic functions that make numbers display nicely. 
             In most real-world problems, the datasets are raw and we need to deal with 
             number formats to make them readable for humans or for computers. 
             Usually, a few or more lines of coding are needed while dealing with 
             number-display problems so we are thinking of compressing the time and 
             programming work on this issue. This package solves this kind of 
             problems in a way of transfer forward and backward from long digit 
             numbers to human-readable ones. There are functions doing single 
             number transactions, column transactions from a pandas data frame, 
             and displaying colors of input numbers.

## Scope

- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#package-categories) this package falls under: (Please check an appropriate box below. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):

	- [ ] data retrieval
	- [ ] data extraction
	- [x] data munging
	- [ ] data deposition
	- [ ] workflow automation
	- [ ] version control
	- [ ] citation management and bibliometrics
	- [ ] scientific software wrappers
	- [ ] field and lab reproducibility tools
	- [ ] database software bindings
	- [ ] geospatial data
	- [ ] text analysis

- Explain how and why the package falls under these categories (briefly, 1-2 sentences):
> The `NiceNumbeRRR` package is primarily used to make numbers more human readable for the purpose of generating nicely formatted charts, reports, or presentations. The package falls under the category of data munging because it is to be used for processing data from formats loaded by raw data. 

-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?
> The target audience is a user that often creates autogenerated reports on regular intervals and wants their formatting to look nice when they submit the reports to the public or their superiors. The scientific applications of this package could include any sort of reporting that contains large numbers that aren't very human readable.

-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#overlap)?
> Yes, the package [humanize](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/humanize/humanize.pdf) is very similar to this package. The `NiceNumbERRR` package differs slightly in that it offers a function to easily apply formatting to dataframes and change the color of numbers. 

-   (If applicable) Does your package comply with our [guidance around _Ethics, Data Privacy and Human Subjects Research_](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#ethics-data-privacy-and-human-subjects-research)?

-   If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or @tag the editor you contacted.
